/// after creating the container of your application inside the docker desktop
    we have to import that container into the minikube

// we have a lot of concept which tells about the

1)  make sure to run the docker desktop first
        cause the minikube is an image which is created with docker as its virtualizer
        ( we can have multiple hypervisors
            in windows we have Hyper-V which is one of the features which we can add
            but for running the minikube with the Hyper-V we have to install the
            minikube manually
        )THIS WAS ROLE OF HYPERVISORS WITH KUBERNETES

2) after running the docker desktop we have to
    start the minikube from the docker driver

        minikube start --driver=docker
    verify weather its running or not
        -> kubectl get notes
3) after successfully running the minikube
    we have to check the minikube cluster (of what images does the minikube contains)

    for that use the command(ONLY IN THE POWERSHELL)
    & minikube -p minikube docker-env | Invoke-Expression
    or
    {
      minikube docker-env(inside the no ps terminal)
      It will output something like:
      SET DOCKER_HOST=tcp://127.0.0.1:...
      SET DOCKER_CERT_PATH=...
      SET DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1

      Copy & paste those SET commands manually into cmd
      Example:
      SET DOCKER_HOST=tcp://127.0.0.1:...
      SET DOCKER_CERT_PATH=C:\Users\...\certs
      SET DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1

      After that:
      docker images
    }


    //This command is used for connecting your local Docker CLI
     to Minikube's internal Docker daemon.
     What It Actually Does:
     Without this command:
     bash
     docker ps  # Shows containers from your LOCAL Docker Desktop/WSL
     docker images  # Shows images from your LOCAL machine
     After running this command:
     bash
     docker ps  # Shows containers running INSIDE Minikube
     docker images  # Shows images stored IN Minikube's Docker registry

4) all what we did above was to check weather we have already imported the order-api image into the
    minikube or not
    if not

    we have to
        minikube image load order-api:1.0
        and again run
        docker image (after minikude cli config)///above step
        NOW WE CAN ABLE TO SEE THE order-api image

5) for running that image we have to configure somethings
    which are
            1) create the order-api-deployment.yaml(Deployment yaml for your microservice)
            2) create the order-api-service.yaml(service yaml for your microservice)
