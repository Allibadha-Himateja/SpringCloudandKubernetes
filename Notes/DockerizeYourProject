// this is the file which will tell you how to containerize your springboot application


the process starts with
creating the jar file of your present application

1) open the terminal for the project you want to containerize
FOR INSTANCE WE TAKE
---PS D:\SpringFiles\SpringCloud&Kubernetes\OrderAPI>
2) we have to run the following command to create the jar file for this application
    -------------->mvn clean package
        this will compile and test the application and after all that
        we will create the jar packages
     THIS WILL CREATE THE JAR PACKAGING OF THIS APPLICATION
     IN THE     /target Folder inside your project
3) Testing the jar packaging weather it is running or not
    -------------> java -jar target/OrderAPI-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
    -> this will initiate the Springboot application
    -> which hosts the order controller at port:8082
    -> test this controller's endpoint with the postman get call

4) after making sure that our jar packaging will run we have to
    CREATE THE DOCKER FILE FOR YOUR PROJECT WHICH WILL be responsible for
    creating the Docker image for your project
    ----->Dockerfile can only be one for each project
    #FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jdk-alpine
    #WORKDIR /app
    #COPY target/OrderAPI-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar app.jar
    #ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","app.jar"]

    this is a basic docker file for any project(springboot)

5) for creating the image for this application
    we have this command
    -> docker build -t(tag option) <image_name> <path>
    -> for this instance we have
           docker build -t order-api:1.0  .
       here the order-api:1.0 is the name:tag for the image
       the name of the resulting image is "order-api" and the tag is "1.0"
       AND "."  IS THE CURRECT LOCATION WHICH CONTAINS THE DOCKERFILE for our app

6) CHECKING WEATHER WE HAVE CREATED THE DOCKERIMAGE OR NOT
    with command
            docker images
            we can able to see the image name "order-api" .

7) now that we have a Docker image we need to be able to run this application from the docker
        docker run <docker-imagename>:tag
        // randomly the image will create a container(WITH RANDOM CONTAINER NAME)
        //docker run --name my-container image-name:tag

        // IMPORTANT : -p IS USED FOR PORT-MAPPING or PORT-PUBLISHING
        // docker run -p HOST_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT image_name:tag
            so we have hosting port which is in application.properties (8082)
            and for the container we can host with different port (anything like 44444 or 11111 etc....)

        /// the commad which will run our app container is
            docker run -p 8082:8082 order-api:1.0

8) check the url with postman
    make a get call for this end point and we will get the "this is order controller" message.....
