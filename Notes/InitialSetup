// for implementing the kubernetes architecture
// we must have the prerequisite knowledge of few concepts

->Docker Containerisation
->VM's virtualization
->Distributed IP's

the introduction of Kubernetes is a vast concept before that we will be taking few
installation and configuration steps for Docker and Kubernetes

---> INSTALLATION AND SETTING UP THE DOCKER IN WINDOWS
for the docker installation we need to go  docker website and download the docker for the windows
and it is also recommended to use the docker desktop

after installation and setup of the docker
we have to test the docker installation from the command prompt using the command
docker desktop start
this will start the docker desktop

// after successfully running the docker desktop

--->  THE MOST CRUCIAL TOOL WHICH IS ESSENTIAL FOR USING THE KUBERNETES IN THE LOCAL NODE IS
      > kubectl

THE KUBECTL IS AUTOMATICALLY DOWNLOADED WHEN WE DOWNLOAD AND SETUP THE DOCKER DESKTOP

so we dont have to manually install the kubectl by ourselves

->>> we have to next pull an image in the docker desktop

--> that is minikube -> this is a opensource tool to run and maintain the kubernetes cluster inside your
local system/machine

-> the command for installing the minikube in the local docker desktop
------- >minikube start --driver=docker
this is download and create the container in the docker desktop
( CHECKOUT THE CMD PROMPTS.TXT FOR DETAILS)

so after installing and running the minikube in the docker
we have to verify wheather it is running or not with the below commands
-> kubectl get nodes
-> minikube status
-> minikude dashboard(kubernetes dashboard which hold services/container/pods .....etc)

if the minikube is running we will get the success status with this commands
